# Project 1

## Hangman

The objective of this game is to guess the letters that make up a word. The amount of letters is decided by the amount of hash marks that appear on the page. You are given an alphabet to guess the letter from and you are given six chances to guess all the correct letters. If you guess all the right letters, a pop-up will appear that says "you win." If you guess the wrong letters with in six chances, a pop-up will appear that says "you lose."

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery for my project languages.

My goals of my hangman project in the future are:
1. make it responsive.
2. add a 2 player mode.
3. add an actual animated image for my hangman that adds head and limbs to the      noose, also create a platform for the noose to hang from.
4. add hints for the word you want to guess.
5. add questions to ask to start the game off.
6. redo the css and html to make the game go along with the responsiveness.

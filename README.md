## Hangman

The objective of this game is to guess the letters that make up a word. The amount of letters is decided by the amount of hash marks that appear on the page. You are given an alphabet to guess the letter from and you are given six chances to guess all the correct letters. If you guess all the right letters, a pop-up will appear that says "you win." If you guess the wrong letters with in six chances, a pop-up will appear that says "you lose."
